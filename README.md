# Lumen Frontend

This is part of the Wattsworth Sensor Network framework. See `http://wattsworth.net` for details. 

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. The frontend communicates with the Lumen API available at `https://github.com/wattsworth/lumen-api`. This should be running locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Build

Run `ng build --configuration production --prod` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
